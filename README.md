# CorsairCove
A Single HTML File for using [Ryuk-me/Torrent-Api-py](https://github.com/Ryuk-me/Torrent-Api-py/). \
The Server runs with Python or docker and the client can be shared and used to access the said server. \
and keeping it mobile friendly and _somewhat_ responsive!! \

Only using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** :3


## Execute
You only need a not ancient browser like IE. that's it!
because it's a javascript code that the browser runs and no server side shenanigans (except the api)


## TODO
- get trending and recent working
- beautiful and compact listing
- adding [torrents.csv](https://torrents-csv.com/) support native in js code as another site
- Colorful result icons
